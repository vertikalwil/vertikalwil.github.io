This site uses Lemon Milk Pro for the body and headers and Mono Lisa for code.

They are paid-for fonts and I have bought licenses for both.

Anyone wishing to use these fonts in their sites MUST purchase their own licenses for the webfonts, available from the following sites:

Lemon Milk Pro: <https://www.myfonts.com/collections/lemon-milk-pro-font-marsnev>
MonoLisa: <https://www.monolisa.dev> (note that the Complete license is required for the webfont)

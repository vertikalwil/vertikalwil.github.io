 Hello! Thanks for visiting my website. I'm Vertikal Willis, 25 years old. I'm from Medan and now living in Jakarta. 
 I've got 5 years of work experience, mostly as a buyer/procurement professional. 
 I decided to switch careers to data science because I feel it suits me better. 
 Processing complex data in creative ways to find strong insights and solutions gives me real joy. 
 I think a data scientist is like an artist, using data in various creative ways to solve problems â€“ it's an art form!

 
I also enjoy teaching, that's why you see the tutorial section on the homepage!

On this occasion, I would like to discuss one of my projects that involves the telco customer churn dataset. Who doesn't know about telco customer churn? This dataset is exceedingly common, and I'm confident that every data science practitioner has worked with it at some point. So, why am I still using this dataset? It's because I want to demonstrate a different and more detailed approach on how to process it. Here, I will conduct a deeper Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and showcase how to create and fine-tune a machine learning model to align it with the intended business objectives, followed by interpreting the results.

Of course, the goals of this project are to produce actionable insights and the most suitable predictive model aligned with the existing business concepts.
On this particular blog post, I will show detailed step by step on how to do the projects (including the codes) so this will be very technical, but if you just want to see the big picture you can see the google slides presentation below : (go full screen by clicking 3-dot option button and choose 'Full Screen')

Let's jump into the code.
